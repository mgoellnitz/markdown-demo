# All Markdown Project Setup Demonstrator

This is an illustrator project without any real code inside.

See Wiki via its link in the navigation bar above or on the left, why this was 
done and what it is meant to show.

* Issues: 
  [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/backendzeit/markdown-demo/blob/trackdown/issues.md)
  [GitHub](https://github.com/mgoellnitz/markdown-demo/blob/trackdown/issues.md)
  [CodeBerg](https://codeberg.prg/backendzeit/markdown-demo/src/trackdown/issues.md)
* Roadmap:
  [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/backendzeit/markdown-demo/blob/trackdown/roadmap.md)
  [GitHub](https://github.com/mgoellnitz/markdown-demo/blob/trackdown/roadmap.md)
  [CodeBerg](https://codeberg.org/backendzeit/markdown-demo/src/trackdown/roadmap.md)

(The links above had to be presented as direct links to [GitLab](gitlab) and the
mirror sites, while [Bitbucket][bitbucket] doesn't seem to have a stable link to 
the  latest issues and roadmap file. There may be other mirrors of this repository 
to show how they interact with other services.)

This project is meant to demonstrate, how to close the gap between the
[Mercurial][hg], [GIT][git], or other DVCS approach to have your code
repository with history and  branches local to your system and the project 
documentation wiki and issue tracker sitting on remote systems.

With the usual setup you would not be able to commit in disconnected situations,
since you would not be able to dig out the issue reference to mention in your
commit message. Likewise you cannot brain-dump the documentation notes 
immediately as you write the code since the wiki to hold that is remote.

Besides: Its really faster to get to the real work of writing notes and
processing issues - like we should get the code written instead of loosing
time in the mere access to the tools we'd like to use.
