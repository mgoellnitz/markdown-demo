# All Markdown Project Setup Demonstrator

This is an illustrator project without any real code inside.

See Wiki via its link in the navigation bar above why this was done and what 
it is meant to show.

* Issues: 
  [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/backendzeit/markdown-demo/blob/trackdown/issues.md)
  [GitHub](https://github.com/mgoellnitz/markdown-demo/blob/trackdown/issues.md)
* Roadmap:
  [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/backendzeit/markdown-demo/blob/trackdown/roadmap.md)
  [GitHub](https://github.com/mgoellnitz/markdown-demo/blob/trackdown/roadmap.md)

(The links above only point to the root repository at [GitLab][gitlab] and the
main mirror. [Bitbucket][bitbucket] doesn't seem to have a stable link to the 
lastest issues and roadmap file. There may be other mirrors of this repository 
to show how they interact with other services.)

This project is meant to demonstrate, how the gap between the git approach to 
have your code repository with history and branches local to your system while
the project documentation wiki is remote as is the issue tracker.

With the usual setup you would not be able to commit in disconnected situations,
since you would not be able to dig out the issue reference to mention in your
commit message. Likewise you cannot brain-bumpd the documentation notes 
immediately as you write the code since the wiki to hold that is remote.

Besides: Its really faster to get to the real work of writing notes and
processing issues - like we should get the code written instead of loosing
time in the mere access to the tools we'd like to use.
